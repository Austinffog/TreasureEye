Pickup Script
This is to document the bug that occurred in the Pickup script.

Issue: Raycast bug with if statement
A bug would occur when the raycast hit one of the objects. 
If the raycast hit the poisonous dagger and the user clicked to add it to an inventory, it would be added in the first slot. 
Then if the user clicked to add the blood it would be added to the second slot. Everything appeared to be working correctly.
The bug occurred if the user clicked the blood first and added it to the inventory, then the poisonous dagger would automatically fill the first slot.

Fix
This bug occurred due to how the if statements and conditions were written. They were rewritten, at first the name of the gameobject collider was checked only.
Fixed by checking both the name of the gameobject collider hit by the raycast and the name of the gameobject.
